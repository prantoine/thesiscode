# thesiscode
Stata, Python and Julia code used for my master's thesis. This is not for replication purposes as there is no guarantee that the code will run out of the box, though it contains information on the data extraction process and how I created my graphs and regressions.
However, Julia code can be run to obtain graphs since the structure of the folders is the same and the required data files are in this repository.
